- **Project overview**

This project dives into the complex relationship between suicide and homicide rates, exploring how gender, societal factors, and psychological challenges intersect in these acts. Although both suicide and homicide result in the taking of life, they differ in motivations and implications, sparking questions about human psychology, societal pressures, and underlying mental health struggles.

In comparing these two forms of life-ending acts, I seek to understand - maybe even similar- patterns, correlations, and potential predictive factors. Suicide, an act of turning against oneself, and homicide, an outward projection of violence, both raise important questions about despair, societal influences, and the factors that drive individuals to these extremes.

- **Motivation**

As someone who has always been fascinated by the depths of human psychology, I am interested in exploring why individuals engage in self-destructive or violent behavior. Suicide and homicide are basically two sides of the same coin : they both involve an end to life, often linked to despair, hopelessness, or external pressures. 

- **Objectives**

1. Compare Suicide and Homicide Rates: Analyze global and regional trends to understand how these rates vary across countries and continents.
2. Explore Gender Differences: Investigate whether men and women differ significantly in suicide and homicide rates (as well as in methods used?)
3. Identify Societal Correlations: Examine how factors like gender equality and other factors like economic conditions and cultural norms correlate with suicide and homicide rates.
4. Determine Trends Over Time: Identify any long-term trends in these rates, focusing on whether rates are increasing or decreasing and in which regions or demographics these changes are most 
   prominent.

- **Project Plan for Data Analysis**
  1. Understanding data, goal definition: specify connections to investigate, overview of data, set time frame, regions
  2. Data Cleaning/Preparation: duplicates, missing values, calculate key variables
  3. SQL Database: maybe(!)
  4. EDA: basic statistics, examine correlations, analyze trends
  5. Hypothesis-Driven Analysis: what relationships do I expect?, test
  6. Results/interpretation: summarize Key Insights, interpret main findings, significance of relationships found
  7. Presentation and Documentation: visualizations of findings (tableau), document methods, analyses, findings
